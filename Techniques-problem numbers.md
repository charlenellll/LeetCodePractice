## Problems related to Array

To begin with, a simple question: 283

+ To minimize space complexity to O(1), use an extra index k as pointer.
	+ Exercise: 27,26,80

Some classic problems:

+ Quick sort with 3-way partition:75

Exercise: 88(Merge), (215)

+ Two pointers:
	+ Collider pointer: 167,125,344,345,11
	+ Sliding window: 209,3,438,(76-hard）

## Problems related to Hash Table

+ Set: 349
+ Map: 350

Exercise: 242, 202, (290(pattern), 205,(同构) 451)

A classic problem : 1

4-4 (Exercise: 15, 18, 16(We may not need Hash Table in this problem))-All are medium!

All hash table problems requires our determination on what to search for:

+ Select the key flexibly: 454, 447(a little technically complicated for beginners in C++ or any other language)

4-5 (Exercise: 49-medium; 4-6: 149-hard)

+ Hash table + sliding window: 219

Compare the similarity and differences between 3# and 219#:

Similarity: 

	+ They are both problems about hash table + sliding window.

Differences:

	+ The number of values is limited in 3#, only 256 types, so we used an array instead of set or map.
	+ The size of sliding window is flexible in 3# while it is fixed in 219#.

Exercise: 217 (Simpler than )

220(More difficult than 219)
