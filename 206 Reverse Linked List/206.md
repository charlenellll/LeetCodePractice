	Reverse a singly linked list.

	Hint:
	A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

# Solutions

As it suggested in the hind, there are two ways of implementation:

Iteratively, or recursively.

This problem is really simple. See the code for the solution.
