Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

## SQL User-defined Function! + LIMIT M,1 (M = N-1)

**Note that:** We can't do calculation inside LIMIT! So we have to declare another variable to be N-1 and put it inside LIMIT!
