	Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

# Possible Solution

We can use a similar sliding window with 219#.

Except that we want to know if there are two elements (v,x) whose absolute difference <= t.

In other words, ceil(v-t) <= v+t or v-t <= floor(v+t), there must be an x fulfills the requirements.
