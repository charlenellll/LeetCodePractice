	Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

# Possible Solution

We can use a similar sliding window with 219#.

Except that we want to know if there are two elements (v,x) whose absolute difference <= t.

So when we read a element v, we can search the search table to see if any value between v-t and v+t exists.

In other words, ceil(v-t) <= v+t or v-t <= floor(v+t) (we just need one of them), there must be an x fulfills the requirements.

// ceil(v-t) is the smallest element that >= v-t

In C++, lower_bound(v-t) <= v+t, then there exists an x in the sliding window that fulfills the requirement.

We need ordered set in this problem because we want to know the lower bound.

### A small trap in Leetcode

when t is really large, our operation will overflow the int number.

So change all int operations to long long operations.
