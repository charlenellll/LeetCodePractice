	Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

	For example,
	Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

	Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

# Solution

Use 4 pointers.

+ Set the nodes we want to swap as node1 & node2
+ The one before them is p, the one after them is next
+ Do the swap: node2->next = node1, node1->next = next, p->next = node2
+ p = node1 and do the next iteration
