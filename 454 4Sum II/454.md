Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.

Example:

	Input:
	A = [ 1, 2]
	B = [-2,-1]
	C = [-1, 2]
	D = [ 0, 2]

	Output:
	2

	Explanation:
	The two tuples are:
	1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
	2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0

# Possible Solutions

## S1: directly solve it

Traverse through A,B,C,D

//O(n^4)

## S2: Put elements of D into a search table

//O(n^3)

## S3: 

Put each possible value of C+D into a search table, traverse A+B to find the solution.

Or put each possible A+B and C+D into two search tables.

//O(n^2) 500^2 is acceptable for modern computers.

#### 在这道题用两个search table分别存A+B和C+D的值会有2个test case不通过，原因很简单：

+ 假设A+B共有m个可能的值，C+D有k个；大概率m > n, k > n
+ 第二个循环（遍历两个map时）时间复杂度为O(mk)，大概率远远大于O(n^2)，造成超时
