Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],
	   1
	    \
	     2
	    /
	   3
return [1,3,2].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


# Solution

It is the same answer as 144# and 145# except the order of putting nodes in the stack.
