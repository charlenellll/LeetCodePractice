	You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
	
	Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Dynamic Programming

Be aware of the specific definition of the state and its Recursive Equation.

Let f(x) be: // the definition of the state  
Considering robbing house in the range [x..n-1].
+ It's not "WILL steal from x", but "possibly steal from house x to n-1/ try robbing"

Recursive equation://Let nums(x) be the value of house x  

money[i] = max(money[i-1], money[i-2]+nums[i]);//不rob当前 和 rob当前
