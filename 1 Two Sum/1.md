Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].

# Possible Solutions

## S1: directly search for the result

:( Bad idea.
// O(n^2)

## S2: Use 2 index as collider pointer

Sort the array + collider pointer:

// O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn)

Remember to pair the value and its index before sorting.

## S3: Use Search Table

Put each element a(paired with its index) into a search table, then find if target-a exists in the table.

Use Map other than Set (stores the element-index pairs).
