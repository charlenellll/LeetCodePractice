You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

	      10
	     /  \
	    5   -3
	   / \    \
	  3   2   11
	 / \   \
	3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11

## Solution

It is tricky and a little difficult.  
This problem concerns a little more complicated recursive process.

At each vertex we do:
1. Check if any path by its children would have the value sum-v.val (assume the path contains this vertex itself) - another recursive function
2. Check if any path by its children would have the value sum (assume the path starts from its children) - the main recursive function



## 代码层面看子过程分解（请直接看2nd round代码思路清晰）

+ 主函数一定和整个问题目的相同：既包含与当前结点连续的路径（即包含当前结点）又包含不连续（即不含当前结点）的路径，即包含不连续
+ helper函数解决子问题：只连续
+ 主函数可分解为：当前结点的必须连续路径数 + 左右子树含不连续路径的数目（但必然不含当前节点，与之断开）
+ 在主函数中不必对左右子树的返回值进行加减因为这些路径与当前节点不相连，而那些符合条件的路径数在只连续的helper函数中已经得到了返回。
