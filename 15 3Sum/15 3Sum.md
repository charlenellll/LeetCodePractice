Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
	[
	  [-1, 0, 1],
	  [-1, -1, 2]
	]

## Some changes based on two sum

1. Sort the array
2. Regard each element as the target
3. Scan the rest of array using two pointers, do the two sum
4. Remember to take care of duplicate numbers

### Trap

I use int "index" to mark the target element.

When dealing with duplicate nums[index], I should always use the first nums[index], not the last one. Because the other duplicate nums[index] after the first one may make up the solution with some large numbers.

For example, the original sorted array is [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]:

If I use the second -1, there is only one solution [-1,0,1], it missed the other solution [-1,-1,2] because I skipped the other -1 if I were to use the second -1 as target.
