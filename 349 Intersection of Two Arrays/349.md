	Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

	Example:
	Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].

	Note:
		Each element in the result must be unique.
		The result can be in any order.

# Possible Solution

Use sets.

+ Put all elements in nums1 in a set.
+ Search if elements in nums2 are in the set, if any element does, put it to a common set.

By this problem, we can be familiar with how to use Set in different languages.
