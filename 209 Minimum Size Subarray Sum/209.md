	Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

	For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
	the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

	If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

# Possible Solutions

## S1: directly

Traverse all contiguous subarray, check if its sum >= s. [i...sum...j]

//Time Complexity: O(n^3) (After optimization, it can reach O(n^2).)
