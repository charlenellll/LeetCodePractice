	Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

	Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

# Possible Solution

Use two pointer(Collider pointer):
+ l moves from left, r moves from right, calculate min(a[l],a[r])*(r-l).
+ Always move the pointer with smaller a[i] towards the other pointer. If the calculated result > current maxArea, record the max result.
+ move until l meets r, return the maxArea.

## The rule for sliding: the shorter hand moves towards the longer hand

One point needs attention: when height[l] == height[r], it does not matter whether I move l or r (it does not matter which one is larger between height[l+1] and height[r-1]) because:
+ If height[l+1] <= height[l]: 
	+ **if height[r-1] <= height[r]: the area will always smaller than the area between hands[l..r]**, so doesn't matter whether I move l or r
	+ if height[r-1] > height[r]: this condition will be considered in the original logic in my code
+ If height[l+1] > height[l]: it might even be better than height[l] and this is what I seek for.
