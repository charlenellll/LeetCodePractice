Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

For example,
Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.


## Solution

Since the time complexity must be better than O(n log n), we can use a priority queue, which achieves the general time complexity at O(n log k), it works great when k << n.

1. Scan the array and calculate the frequency. O(n)
2. Maintain a priority queue of length k(O(n log k)) instead of sorting(O(n log n)).


## Alternative method

Maintain a priority queue of length (n-k) instead of k.

The time complexity would be O(n log(n-k)) and the code would be more concise.
