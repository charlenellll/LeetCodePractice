	Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

	For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

	Note:
	You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
	Minimize the total number of operations.

# Possible Solutions

## 1. S1: Solve it directly

**Not suggested.**

+ Scan the entire array, copy any non-zero elements into a new array accordingly;
+ Copy the new array back to the original one, then replace any elements after the length of it with zero.

// Time Complexity O(n)

// Space Complexity O(n)

## 2. S2

Store all non-zero elements in the range of [0,k) places in the array. (Set an index k.)

+ Scan the entire array, k starts from the 0th place.
+ When any non-zero element appears, put it to the k(th) place, then move k index forward.
+ When finish scanning the array, fill the rest of the array(from k on) with 0s.

## 3. S3-based on S2 

In the 2nd step: 

Swap the place of 0 and non-zero element. (Save the efforts of filling in the vacancy with 0s).

## 4. S4-based on S3

Only swap the elements when i!=k (Don't swap it with itself when the array consists of non-zero elements only).
