	Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

	Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

	For example,
	Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

	Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.


This problem may be a little bit tricky compared to 283# and 27#.

# Possible Solution

Collect all unique values into [0,k) part of array.

+ Set index k = 0;
+ Scan the entire array (**i starts from 1**), if index i meet with a unique element bigger than val, move k forward and set nums[k] to nums[i].

**Particularly, we should consider the situation that input array is vacant.**
