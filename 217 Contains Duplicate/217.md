	Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

# Solutions

## In Python
 
In this problem, it is totally different in Python from C++ or Java. Cuz Python has many built-in method for Dict(Map).

Note that in the last part we cannot use enumerate() in the for-loop to do the traverse of dict.

For example:

	for i,j in enumerate({'a':1,'b':2}):  
	    print i,j 

The output would be:

	0 a  
	1 b 

It is not the key-value pair.

Instead, we should use dict.keys() in the for-loop.

## In C++ or Java

Actually no need for set.

[But can also be solved by Set (+ Sliding Window.)]
