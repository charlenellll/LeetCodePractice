	Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

	For example:
	Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2,
	return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.

# Solution

Use two pointer.

+ Keep the distance between p and q to k
+ p starts from dummyHead, traverse the linked list, when q->next == NULL, we find the nodes we need to rotate to the front of the liked list.( p points to the node in front of them)
+ Do the rotation by pointers.

Note that the test cases are really weired because sometimes k >> length of the linked list.

So checking the relationship btw k and the real length would be an important step
