Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

	       /              \
	    ___2__          ___8__
	   /      \        /      \
	   0      _4       7       9
	         /  \
	         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

## Solution

Assume the 2 given nodes are p and q:
1. if p and q both less than the current root, run the recursive function on the left subtree by root.
2. if p and q both greater than the current root, run the recursive function on the right subtree of the root.
3. if p and q are not on the same side, the root is the LCA. It contains 3 conditions:
+ p,q are separate in two subtrees, the root is the LCA.
+ if p is the root itself, q is in one of the subtrees, so p(the root) would be the LCA.
+ if q is the root itself, same as above.
