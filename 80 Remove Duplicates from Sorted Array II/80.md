	Follow up for "Remove Duplicates"(26#):
	What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

	For example,
	Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

	Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

# Possible Solution:

Keep at most two of a unique value in the [0,k) part of array.

+ Set index k=0, the count of duplicates count=0;
+ Scan the array starting from i=1(Before this we should consider about an empty array):
	+ If the next value is unique: set count=0, k++ and set nums[k] to nums[i], count=1
	+ If nums[i]==nums[i-1] && count=1: k++ and set nums[k] to nums[i], count=2
	+ (If nums[i]==nums[i-1] && count>1: i++ (no operation in the for loop))
