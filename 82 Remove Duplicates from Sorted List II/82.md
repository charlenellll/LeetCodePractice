	Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

	For example,
	Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.
	Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.

# Solution

Use a set to record the values.

If the next node's value is already in the set, delete the next node and current node.

The trick is, we have to use a pointer pointing to the node before all duplicate nodes.
