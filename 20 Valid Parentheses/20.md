	Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

	The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.

# Solution 

Use a stack to see if they match.

There are stack interface in C++(stack) and Java(Stack). But not in Python(use a list to implement it).
