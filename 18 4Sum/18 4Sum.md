Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example:

Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]

# Solution for K-sum problems

+ 2sum Problem
+ Reduce K sum problem to K – 1 sum Problem

## Remember to remove duplicate result

+ Sort nums to ensure the order
+ 1. All the outer loops: Remove duplicate target
+ 2. Inner loop: Remove duplicate numbers when doing two sum

## Early-stopping tricks

In inner 3sum part: in current scanning range,
+ if the sum of first two elements > target, 换j已不能解决问题: **break**; 
+ if the sum of last two elements < target, target1-nums[j] could be smaller, still possible solutions: **continue**.
