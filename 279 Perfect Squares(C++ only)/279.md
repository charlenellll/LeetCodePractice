Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

For example, given n = 12, return 3 because 12 = 4 + 4 + 4; given n = 13, return 2 because 13 = 4 + 9.

# Solution - Graph

This problem doesn't seem related to graphs, but actually, it is a problem to find the shortest path in a graph.

Use the breadth-first search. So we should use Queue here.

## Model this problem to a Graph problem

Each number n to 0 represents a node, if node x and y's difference is a perfect square number, then we draw an edge. By this definition we get an unweighted graph.
This problem becomes: find the shortest path from n to 0 in the unweighted graph.
