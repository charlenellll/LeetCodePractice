	Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

	Note:
	You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.

# Possible Solution

It is the merge process in Merge Sort.

The tricky part is, assuming two arrays are in ascending order: scanning from the head to the tail costs a lot.

+ Scan from both tails, the largest one will be put to the tail.
