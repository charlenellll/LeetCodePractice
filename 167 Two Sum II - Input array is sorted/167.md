	Given an array of integers that is already ** sorted in ascending order **, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

	The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

	You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

	Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
	Output: index1=1, index2=2

# Possible Solutions

## S1: directly

Traverse the array in the net-iteration. 

// Time Complexity: O(n^2)

## S2: Binary Search

For each i, binary search (target - nums[i]) in nums[i+1...n-1]

// O(nlogn)

## S3： Collider Pointer

l moves from the head while r moves from the tail of the array, towards each other, finding nums[l] + nums[r] == target.

+ Set index l = 0, r = n-1
+ If nums[l] + nums[r] < target, l++
+ if num[l] + num[r] > target, r--
+ Once nums[l] + nums[r] == target, return the two index as a vector/array

//O(n)

Another thing about this problem is, how to return multiple values in C++, Java and Python respectively.

For example, in C++:

	int res[2] = {l+1, r+1};
	return vector<int>(res, res+2);
