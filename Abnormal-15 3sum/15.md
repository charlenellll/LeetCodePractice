Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

	For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

	A solution set is:
	[
	  [-1, 0, 1],
	  [-1, -1, 2]
	]

# Possible Solutions

## S1: Use a hashtable to store all the numbers

+ For every a and b, find if c exists

	+ To identify the unique triplet, we sort every triplet we found and make the sorted-triplet as a string to be the triplet id

Pay attention when all the numbers in a triplet are the same

// Time Complexity: O(n^2)
// Space Complexity: O(n)

However this will reach TLE! So it is not a solid solution in this case.


## S2: Using two pointer technique
 
 + Sort the array first.
 + For every different number a, try to find a pair (b, c), which a + b + c  == 0
 
 In this way, we don't need to check whether the triplet is a repeated one.
