	Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

# Possible Solutions

## S1: directly traverse i and j

//O(n^2)

## S2: Search Table + Sliding Window

The problem then becomes: 

If we can find a pair of elements fullfill the requirment in a sliding window with size k+1.

When i = 0, then j = k, so there are k+1 elements.

So the size of sliding window should be k+1.
