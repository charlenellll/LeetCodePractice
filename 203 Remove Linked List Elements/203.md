	Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.

	Example
	Given: 1 --> 2 --> 6 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6, val = 6
	Return: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5

# Solution

If we directly do the operations, we have to separate the situations of head->val == val, and head->val != val, which can be really nasty if we want to sort every possibility out.

The better solution is using a virtual head pointer- dummyHead, in this way we can do all the math in one form and there is no need to consider head pointer separately.

Virtual head really increases our accuracy and simplifies the algorithm.
