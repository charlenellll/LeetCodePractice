Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:
Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
The array size will not exceed 200.
Example 1:

	Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

	Output: true

	Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Example 2:

	Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

	Output: false

	Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

## Knapsack problem

Pick certain articles and fill them into knapsack of size = sum/2.
+ Notice that we have to fill up the knapsack absolutely, no spare room is allowed.
