Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].

Note:
+ Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
+ The result can be in any order.
Follow up:
+ What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
+ What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
+ What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

# Possible Solution

Use map.

If two arrays are sorted, there is no need to use the Map structure to do the job.

**Note that in Python, Map is not called map, it is dict (AKA dictionary) instead. (And map() is the map in map reduce.)**
