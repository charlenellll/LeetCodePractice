Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example,
Given board =

	[
	  ['A','B','C','E'],
	  ['S','F','C','S'],
	  ['A','D','E','E']
	]
word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.

## Solution

**Backtracking in a 2-D plane.**

The technique of having an array to represent movement in 4 directions in a 2D-plane is extremely useful in many conditions.

	int d[4][2] = {{-1,0},{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1}};

This problem consists of a relatively large number of lines of codes, but is clear in the logic.

I will go through this problem over and over again. It is a classic 2-D dimension backtracking problem.
