Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

For example, given the following binary tree:

	   1
	 /   \
	2     3
	 \
	  5
All root-to-leaf paths are:

["1->2->5", "1->3"]

## Solution

+ Base case: return the vertex when arrives at a leave.
+ Recursive steps: [root->the string of path of left child, root->the string of path of right child]

This problem is interesting because it returns a vactor(representing a path) each time the recursive process is called.
