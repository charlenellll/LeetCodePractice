Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

Note:

Given n will always be valid.

Try to do this in one pass.

# Possible Solutions

## S1

Traverse once to learn the actual length of the linked list

Traverse again to delete the nth node from the end of the list

// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)

It will get passed in the OJ.

It is a reasonable solution if we don't have better solutions.


	Can we do it in one pass? Use S2.

## S2

Use two pointer p and q.

+ p starts from the dummyHead. Keep the # of elements between p and q to n, so the distance btw p and q is n+1
+ Slide two pointer from head to tail together, keep their distance intact.
+ When q is a NULL pointer, p exactly points to the element in front of the element we need to delete, then delete it as usual.
