Implement pow(x, n).


Example 1:

Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100

## Observe the test case:

 We can see that where are some abnormal test case

 1. Runtime error if x * pow(x, n-1) each time: O(N)
 If we use binary divison of n each time, this problem will be solved (of course we shoud consider if n is even or odd)

	0.00001
	2147483647

2. -214783648 is the expression of INT_MIN, it is an illegal expression  
 **INT_MIN = - INT_MAX - 1**  
 So x^(INT_MIN) = 1.0 / x^(INT_MAX + 1)

	2.00000
	-2147483648

## multiple one x each time : O(N) - runtime error for some test case

pow(x,n) = x\*pow(x, n-1)  
It can be implemented in recursive and iterative way. The same time complexity.  
For example:

 	0.00001
	2147483647

## Binary divison of n: O(logN)

pow(x,n) = x\*pow(x\*x, n/2) for odd number,    
= pow(x\*x,n/2) for even number  

It can be implemented in recursive and iterative way. The same time complexity.  

**Remember to deal with INT_MIN**
