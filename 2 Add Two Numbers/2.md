	You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

	You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

	Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
	Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

# Solution

Read-in each digit of two linked list then do the sum.

This problem is about establishing a new linked list.

It seems simple but actually is quite difficult for me when I establish a new linked list for the first time.

There's so much to consider about.

So go over the solution thoroughly.
