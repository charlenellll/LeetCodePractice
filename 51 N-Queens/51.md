The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

	[
	 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
	  "...Q",
	  "Q...",
	  "..Q."],

	 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
	  "Q...",
	  "...Q",
	  ".Q.."]
	]

## Solution

Backtracking.

How to determine if the position is illegal in a fast manner?
+ Use col[i] to represent that i-th column is occupied
+ Use dia1[i] to represent the i-th diagonal-1 is occupied
+ Use dia2[i] to represent the i-th diagonal-2 is occupied

How to represent the array of diagonals?
+ For diagonal-1 (/): the sum i+j is the same at each diagonal-1: 0,1,2,...2n
	+ this array contains 2\*n-1 elements
+ For diagonal-1 (\): the difference i-j is fixed at each one. To avoid negative numbers, we can use i-j+n-1, so it starts from 0 instead of -(n-1).
	+ this array contains 2\*n-1 elements too
