Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
	   1
	    \
	     2
	    /
	   3
return [3,2,1].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


# Solution

It is the same answer as 144# and 94# except the order of putting nodes in the stack.
