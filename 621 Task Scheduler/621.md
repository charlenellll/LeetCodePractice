Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks.Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

	Example 1:
	Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
	Output: 8
	Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
	Note:
	The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
	The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

## Solution

+ Use an int tasknum[26] array to store the number of tasks
+ **Sort the array**, so the task with the greatest number will always be the last one in the array
+ While there is task left ( tasknum[25] != 0 ), do a while loop that for i = 0 to n, reduce tasknum[25-i] if it exist, increase the time no matter if tasknum[25-i] exist because when it does not exist, it is idle and will still take a unit of time.
+ After one round of n tasks, sort the tasknum array again to maintain the maxheap.
+ Repeat until all tasks have been arranged.
