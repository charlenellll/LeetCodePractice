	Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

	For example,
	"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
	"race a car" is not a palindrome.

	Note:
	Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

	For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

# Possible Solution:

Use Collider Pointers.

+ l starts from head of the string, r starts from the tail.
+ If s[l] s[r] are numbers && s[l] == s[r], l++ r--
+ If s[l] s[r] are letters, ignore cases, && s[l] == s[r], l++ r--
+ If s[l] or s[r] are not alphanumeric characters, move index

//In ASCII, lower case characters - corresponding upper case characters = 32

Solutions of this problem is quite different in C++, Python and Java. I haven't found a better solution in Java right now.
One day I would make up for it.
