Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

	Example 1:

	Input:
	s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

	Output:
	[0, 6]

	Explanation:
	The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
	The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:

	Input:
	s: "abab" p: "ab"

	Output:
	[0, 1, 2]

	Explanation:
	The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
	The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
	The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

# Possible Solution

Use a sliding window.

// The ASCII code for lower case characters are 97-122.

+ Use freq[26] to record the frequency of characters appeared in p and s.(ASCII % 97 or char-'a')
+ Use a sliding window on string s: keep the size of sliding window to the size of string p, keep r++,freq[s(r)] ++
+ Else freq[s(l)] -- and l++
+ If freq[] in p == freq in s[l...r], record l

One tricky thing about this problem is:

In different languages, it uses different containers to do the operation or store the result.

And different containers have different applications to compare if they have the same values.
