# Original problem description

	Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

	Example:
	Given s = "hello", return "olleh".

# Revised Problem description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

	Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
	Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


Example 2:

	Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
	Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

# Possible Solution:

Using collider pointer.

Note that the implementation is quite different i C++, Java, Python:
+ It is an ordinary array(string) operation in C++
+ In Java, String object has its own methods. We can concert it into charArray, do the algorithm and put it into a new String object
+ In Python, string is unchangable. We should first convert it to a list, do the operations, and return "".join(list)
