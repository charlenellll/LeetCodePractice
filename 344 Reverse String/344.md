	Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

	Example:
	Given s = "hello", return "olleh".

# Possible Solution:

Using collider pointer.

Note that the implementation is quite different i C++, Java, Python:
+ It is an ordinary array(string) operation in C++
+ In Java, String object has its own methods. We can concert it into charArray, do the algorithm and put it into a new String object
+ In Python, string is unchangable. We should first convert it to a list, do the operations, and return "".join(list)
