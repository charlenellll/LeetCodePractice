Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
	   1
	    \
	     2
	    /
	   3
return [1,2,3].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


# Solution

To avoid doing it recursively, we use a stack to imitate the system stack.

The order of commands we push into the stack should be the reverse order of the actual sequential implementation.

Last-in, first-out.
